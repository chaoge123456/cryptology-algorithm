Nowadays, huge amount of data is created and distributed from
different resources [1, 2]. With reduction in cost of storing
information and existing infrastructures such as cloud computing
and grid computing, there is the opportunity to extract knowledge
from them. Besides the security problems in data mining
techniques, new security challenges have emerged in big data
mining, which are related to the necessity of using distributed
computing for big data analysis [3]. So, privacy concerns are
aggravated because distributed information can be recovered easily
rather than aggregated form. Association rule mining is one of the
most important data mining techniques. However, misuse of this
technique may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about
users [4, 5]. Many researches have been done in association rule
hiding [6¨C10] and most of them present algorithms that delete
items from transactions for hiding sensitive rules. Unfortunately,
undesired side effect is obvious in these algorithms. To solve this
problem, researchers try to use greedy-based approaches. However,
these approaches cannot guarantee finding an optimal solution and
only try to increase their efficiency. In this research, in order to
hide sensitive association rules in big data mining, instead of
removing repeated instance of sensitive association rules,
anonymisation methods are used to hide sensitive rules. By doing
this, besides hiding sensitive information, undesired side effect of
deleting frequent item-sets (ISs) on new entrance data, would be
removed. To make this approach suitable for big data analysing,
parallelisation and scalability features are considered, too.
Sensitive degree of each association rule is determined using
appropriate membership functions and anonymisation would be
done based on it.
